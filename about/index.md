## What is Moonshot Thinking?
Moonshot Thinking is when we choose a huge problem, and propose to create a radical solution to the problem using disruptive technology. Also, a moonshot aims for a 10x impact on the problems, not just a 10% improvement.

## What makes a great Moonshot?   
* Clearly Defined Problem   
* Radical Proposal to fix the problem   
* Scientific Reason to believe it   

## What is a Moonshot mindset?   
* It is about the quality of experiments not the quality of the outcome   
* Embracing failure   
* To make a ton of progress we have to go through a ton of failures   
* Start from a plain sheet of paper   
* Figure it as you go   
* Believe   
* No excuses   
* Fail fast
